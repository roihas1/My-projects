# My projects
This repository includes a few projects I did through my Software and Information System Engineering degree.

## Projects
List of projects in the repository:

* Sport-event-management:
    A NestJS backend with a React client for managing sports events. Features include:
    User Roles: Regular users and event organizers (admins).
    Event Management: Create, update, and manage events.
    Team Registration: Register and manage teams.
    Match Scheduling: Auto-generate, view, and manage schedules, including tournament bracket scheduling.
    Authentication: Secured with JWT for user login and access control.
  
* F1 website:
    This Website is built with Vue on the client side and NestJS on the server side. The website contains information about Formula 1 drivers and tracks from around the world.
    It uses an open API to retrieve information about drivers and tracks.
    Additionally, the OpenAI API is integrated to provide a summary of each driver.
    MySQL stores summaries and information retrieved from the database to save runtime.
    The structure -> In the F1 folder their 2 folders, one for the backend and one for the frontend, inside them, there is the src folder with the code files.
    Still in progress...

* Search Engine: 
  This project is a Flask app based application that gets a query and returns several Wikipedia related website names.
  I worked with GCP to run this and get the query through the server.
  While creating this project I experimented WORD2VEC model, Cosine Similarity and more.

* Pokedex: 
  In this project I created a system that allows Pokemon battles as well as a Pokedex (a data structure that keeps all your Pokemons) that will contain information
  about the Pokemon and existing Pokemon types.
  
* Maze Game: 
  A maze game application that runs on the JavaFX platform. 
  Those projects include some design patterns such as Strategy and more, additionally there is a use of client-server design.
   
* Farm Market:
  The system of farms, animals and goods, lets you trade your goods between farmers.
  As part of the code design I used the observer design pattern that allows each farmer to notify his customers when he has any goods for sale.
  
* Face recognition:
  A Python script for face recognition through the webcam of the laptop. To run the script, it is necessary to enter a few images so that the algorithm will  
  learn to recognize faces.
